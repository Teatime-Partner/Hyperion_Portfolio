# Hyperion_Portfolio

Hi! 
This is my project repositorty. It contains all projects I have worked on during my Bootcamp and more, including bits I've worked on in my free time to get better.

My projects:
- CallBack
- Javascript
- Palindrome
- Survey project
- Table
- Word swap

## Contents

- **[CallBack]**\
  The project is a simple javascript code that runs async function. It uses setInterval(), clearInterval() and DOM manipulation to create a functional counter that displays a numerical value for every 1s.
  Function is controlled by onClick events for start and stop.

- **[Javascript]**\
  Contains various javascript functions and projects that don't have additional files associated with them, and work as standalone scripts.
    * *digitalHideSeek.js*\
      Createds a function to navigate nested fuctions and code sope. It contains a lot of commented out code that presents my thinking about the task and possible solutions to it.
    * *functions.js*\
      Contains simple functions for mathematic operations.
    * *higherOrder.js*\
      This task was really fun and pushed me to think outside the box. The goal was to create a filter function without ussing .filter() method to iterate through the array and return a new array that contains only elements that are true.
    * *inventory.js*\
      Object manipulation task. Contains various functions that can filter through the object and edit values as required. This code went througha lot of changes and reforming - from very long if statements to iterate through everything to very streamlined       generic version that will successfully run through various arrays if the conditions are met.

- **[Palindrome]**\
  This was a very fun project to construct a palindrome searcher and was my first DOM manipulation projects as well, since I didn't enjoy to constantly check the console for the log to confirm my inputs, and I thought that running the button, promt and displaying a result on the page was a very neat idea.\
  Folder contains html and js files. palindrome2.js is my testing file that I've decided to include.
  
- **[Survey project]**\
  This is my very first project, made thanks to increadible tutorial at freeCodeCamp! It was the moment when I've realised that I can do this, go through all the errors and hurdles, and create something I'm proud of! Contains both html and css files.

- **[Table]**\
  Table, or rather periodic table, is a project that dips into resposive web design. Thanks to this I have a better understanding of responsive web apps and decided to use Bootstrap for any future projects, as it offers a more steamline approach. The folder contains html, css and picture that's referenced for the breakpoint.

- **[Word swap]**\
  Project that executes a function on button press. The function takes the number input from the user and returns a reversed number. Both numebrs are displayed for the use to compare in a p element. Folder contains both html and js files, required for execution.
